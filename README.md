This project contains the specification of the API only, no implementations.  The API is specified using 
[OpenAPI v3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0), which defines a standard, programming language-agnostic 
interface description for HTTP APIs.

The OpenAPI specification can be used in tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
to document and mock the API during development.  It can also be used by other tools to automatically generate code,
or to generate test suites for implementations of the API.
